# Project Overview

The project demonstrates data visualization techniques with Tableau. We created a synthetic dataset for an imaginary company called Angel Investment Inc. and used various visualization techniques to find meaning in this data.

# Story

Angel Investment Inc. is a multifaceted, online crowdfunding platform which helps people acquire small business loans for different sectors while providing lenders the opportunity to invest in profitable projects. Angel's success lies in the fact that its lenders have provided over $400 million dollars in loans to over 1 million people.  

In order to set investment priorities, inform lenders and understand the target communities, we want to know the borrowing trends in high performing sectors and its sub-categories (activity). However, this requires inference based on a limited set of information for each borrower.

The dataset features information of lenders across 70+ countries in different sectors and the distribution of loan amounts disbursed to borrowers . We aim to understand the trends in this data and maximize the impact of  disbursing loans to projects. 

To present lucrative investment opportunities for the lenders, we focused on the top 5 countries and methodologically identified the highest performing sectors and activites in these countries on the basis of loan amounts requested.

This helped us better understand the borrowing trends based on historical data and forecast loan demand for  future business growth. The following images shows some of the analysis we have done:
